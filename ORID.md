Today's lesson covered the basics of prompting, creating user personas, and mapping user journeys. We learned how to craft effective prompts, the importance of understanding user demographics and behaviors, and how to visualize the user's interaction with a product or service through journey mapping.

R:
I felt intrigued and motivated throughout the lesson. The concept of creating user personas was particularly eye-opening because it highlighted the diversity of user needs and preferences. The exercise on mapping user journeys was challenging but engaging, as it required a lot of critical thinking and empathy. With the help of making personas and journey, we can make our application more fit to the users' requirements.

I:
The main takeaways from today's lesson are the importance of clear and concise prompting to guide user interactions, the value of detailed user personas in designing user-centered products, and the insights gained from mapping user journeys to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.

D:
Based on today's lesson, I plan to apply these concepts in my future projects by creating detailed user personas and journey maps before starting the design process. This will help ensure that the products I work on are user-centered and address real user needs. My next step is to practice these skills further by working on a small project or case study.
